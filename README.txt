Program for simulation of random walk of single particle in one-dimensional lattice.

Operating systems: Windows 7 or later
Platforms: x86 (32bit) and x64 (64bit)
Type: native console application

Development environment: MS Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition
Language: C++

Program simulates random walk of single particle in one-dimensional lattice of given size. Particle can occupy discrete positions in lattice cells. Initial position of particle - center of lattice. At each step of simulation particle goes into one of two neighboring cells with given probability. Boundary of lattice wittingly unattainable. Simulation continues given number of steps.

Result of program is calculated probability of finding particle in cell of lattice at arbitrary time: ratio of number of particle visits to given cell of lattice to number of simulation steps.
