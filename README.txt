Program for simulation of random walk of single particle in one-dimensional lattice

Program simulates random walk of single particle in one-dimensional lattice of given size. Particle can occupy discrete positions in the lattice cells. Initial position of particle - center of the lattice. At each step of the simulation particle goes into one of two neighboring cells with given probability. Boundary of the lattice wittingly unattainable. Simulation continues given number of steps.

Result of the program is calculated probability of finding a particle in a cell of the lattice at an arbitrary time: the ratio of number of particle visits to a given cell of the lattice to the number of simulation steps.
